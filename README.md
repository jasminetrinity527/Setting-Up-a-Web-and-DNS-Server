# Setting-Up-a-Web-and-DNS-Server
This report is about the configuration of a Web and DNS Server, which involves registering a domain name, and having website access. A Web Server is a computer system/software that stores the website's content to users over the internet. A DNS Server translates the domain name(s) into IP addresses. In order to set up both servers, you would need to first install the web server itself within a Linux machine, in this case we used Ubuntu (our host machine)  and CentOS. Secondly, we began to configure the DNS Server with the use of many commands, multiple zone files, and creating a map for the domains. Thirdly, we linked the DNS Server with the Web Server, by pointing it to the IP address where the web server website (domain) is hosted on. Lastly, a test was performed to make sure the Web Server and DNS server was properly configured.FOr the sake of this project being a class project the domian name was project435web.online
